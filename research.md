I am interested in design, implementation of system-level programming languages, compilers, 
and formal verification for building reliable, certified software and hardware systems. 
A common theme is constructing correct embedded systems (i.e., control software in 
safety-critical systems, embedded system hardware designs) by applying formal 
verification including static analysis, model checking and correctness proof on the 
source code implementation, or mathematical models of these systems producing by 
model-based design tool-chains, and formally certifying the correctness of the 
compilers and code generators in the model-based design tool-chains.

### Research Projects
[RAML](http://www.raml.co/ "RAML"), 
[DANSE](http://www.danse-ip.eu/home/), 
[DALI](http://www.ict-dali.eu/dali/), 
[VERISYNC](http://www.irit.fr/~Martin.Strecker/Proj/Old/Verisync/), 
[SCALP](http://scalp.gforge.inria.fr/), 
[AVOTE](http://scalp.gforge.inria.fr/)

### Softwares
* __RAML__: Resource Aware ML (RAML) is a tool that automatically and statically computes resource-use bounds (lower and upper) for OCaml programs. It also can check the constant resource-use programs used in preventing timing side-channel attacks, [RAML](http://www.raml.co/) 
* __PSCV__: A runtime verification tool for probabilistic SystemC models. It consists of two components: the plug-in for Plasma Lab in Java and tool for generating C++ monitor and aspect advices in C++, [PSCV](https://project.inria.fr/pscv/)
* __Plasma Lab__: Plasma Lab is a compact, efficient and flexible platform for statistical model checking of stochastic models, [Plasma Lab](https://project.inria.fr/plasma-lab/)
* __Polychrony__: The Polychrony tool-set developed in C++ and Java, based on Signal, provides a formal framework to design, develop and validate critical systems, from abstract specification until deployment on distributed systems, [Polychrony](http://www.irisa.fr/espresso/Polychrony/)
* __SigCert__: The tool developed in OCaml checks the correctness of the compilation of Signal compiler w.r.t clock semantics, data dependence, and value-equivalence (not fully implemented), [SigCert](https://github.com/channgo2203/sigcert)
* __SigCV__: PDS Simulation Relation Checking with SIGALI: implementation of the theory works in IFM 2012 article as the libraries in SIGALI tool-set, [SigCV](https://github.com/channgo2203/SigCV)
* __Mobile Apps__: Mobile applications: RATP, Turnstone, Saigon Places, A86, PhotoEnc,...on [Apple AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8)

### Development
* Embedded software in Assembly, C/C++, and Ada for AVR, ARM, and Arduino Development Boards
* Mobile embedded applications on iOS and Android
* Software development in C/C++, C Sharp, Java, OCaml, and Python
