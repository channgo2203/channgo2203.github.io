I am working as a researcher in the School of Computer Science, and am a member of the Principles of Programming Group at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are in formal methods, programming languages, compilers, and language-based security. 

I received my Engineer degree (equivalent to Diplôme d'Ingénieur) from 
[Hanoi University of Technology](http://en.hust.edu.vn/home) with excellent ranking, 
my M.Sc in Computer Science (under a French government scholarship, Évariste Galois program) 
from [Joseph Fourier University](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/?language=en) 
(Université de Grenoble), and my Ph.D from [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/) 
France under the supervision of [Dr. Jean-Pierre Talpin](http://www.irisa.fr/prive/talpin/).

I am interested in design, implementation of system-level programming languages, 
compilers, and formal verification for building reliable, certified software and 
hardware systems. A common theme is constructing correct embedded systems (i.e., control 
software in safety-critical systems, embedded system hardware designs) by applying formal 
verification including static analysis, model checking and correctness proof on the 
source code implementation, or mathematical models of these systems producing by 
model-based design tool-chains, and formally certifying the correctness of the 
compilers and code generators in the model-based design tool-chains.
