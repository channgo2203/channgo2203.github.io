Chan received his Engineer degree from [Hanoi University of Technology](http://en.hust.edu.vn/home) with excellent ranking, his Master degree in Computer Science (under a French government scholarship, Evariste Galois program) from [Joseph Fourier University](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/?language=en)(University of Grenoble 1), and his Doctorate degree from [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/) Rennes, France.

### Research

Chan is interested in design, implementation of systems-level programming languages, compilers, and formal verification for building reliable, certified software and hardware systems. A common theme is constructing correct embedded systems (i.e., control software in safety-critical systems, embedded system hardware designs) by applying formal verification including static analysis, model checking and correctness proof on the source code implementation, or mathematical models of these systems producing by model-based design toolchains, and formally certifying the correctness of the compilers and code generators in the model-based design toolchains.

### Softwares
- **PSCV**: A runtime verification tool for probabilistic SystemC models. It consists of two components: the plugin for Plasma Lab in Java and tool for generating C++ monitor and aspect advices in C++, [PSCV](https://project.inria.fr/pscv/)
- **Plasma Lab**: Plasma Lab is a compact, efficient and flexible platform for statistical model checking of stochastic models, [Plasma Lab](https://project.inria.fr/plasma-lab/)
- **Polychrony**: The Polychrony toolset developed in C++ and Java, based on Signal, provides a formal framework to design, develop and validate critical systems, from abstract specification until deployment on distributed systems, [Polychrony](http://www.irisa.fr/espresso/Polychrony/)
- **SigCert**: The tool developed in OCaml checks the correctness of the compilation of Signal compiler w.r.t clock semantics, data dependence, and value-equivalence (not fully implemented), [SigCert](https://github.com/channgo2203/sigcert)
- **SigCV**: PDS Simulation Relation Checking with SIGALI: implementation of the theory works in IFM 2012 article as the libraries in SIGALI toolset, [SigCV](https://github.com/channgo2203/SigCV)
- **Mobile Apps**: Mobile applications: RATP, Turnstone, Saigon Places, A86, PhotoEnc,...on [Apple AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8)

### Development
- Embedded software in Assembly, C/C++, and Ada for AVR, ARM, and Arduino Development Boards
- Mobile embedded applications on iOS and Android
- Software development in C/C++, C Sharp, Java, OCaml, and Python
