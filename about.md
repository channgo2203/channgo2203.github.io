Chan received his Engineer degree from [Hanoi University of Technology](http://en.hust.edu.vn/home) with excellent ranking, his Master degree in Computer Science (under a French government scholarship, Evariste Galois program) from [Joseph Fourier University](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/?language=en)(University of Grenoble 1), and his Doctorate degree from [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/) Rennes, France.

### Research

Chan is interested in design, implementation of systems-level programming languages, compilers, and formal verification for building reliable, certified software and hardware systems. A common theme is constructing correct embedded systems (i.e., control software in safety-critical systems, embedded system hardware designs) by applying formal verification including static analysis, model checking and correctness proof on the source code implementation, or mathematical models of these systems producing by model-based design toolchains, and formally certifying the correctness of the compilers and code generators in the model-based design toolchains.

### Softwares
