I will continue to dicuss about the essential data structures and how they are implemented in a functional programming language, OCaml. In this post, I will talk about [Red-Black tree][1] and how it can be implemented in OCaml.

These color bits are used to ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.
