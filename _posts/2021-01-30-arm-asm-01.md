In this post of ARM assembly basics, we will talk about the data types and registers. So let's get started.

## Data types

Similar to high-level programming languages, e.g. C/C++, ARM supports different types of data. 
Data can be:
* signed and unsinged bytes
* signed and unsinged halfwords
* signed and unsinged words

For example, they can be used with `load` and `store` operations as follows:

```asm
ldr         # Load Word
ldrh        # Load unsigned Half Word
ldrsh       # Load signed Half Word
ldrb        # Load unsigned Byte
ldrsb       # Load signed Bytes

str         # Store Word
strh        # Store unsigned Half Word
strsh       # Store signed Half Word
strb        # Store unsigned Byte
strsb       # Store signed Byte
```

## Registers

The number of registers depends on the versions of ARM processors. However, only `16` first general purpose registers are accessible by `user-level` code (of course, there are some exceptions). But, here we assume that user-level code will only access the general purpose registers `0-15`. 
The following table lists them and their descriptions.
