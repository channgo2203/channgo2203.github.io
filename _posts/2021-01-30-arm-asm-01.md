In this post of ARM assembly basics, we will talk about the data types and registers. So let's get started.

## Data types

Similar to high-level programming languages, e.g. C/C++, ARM supports different types of data. 
Data can be:
* signed and unsinged bytes
* signed and unsinged halfwords
* signed and unsinged words
