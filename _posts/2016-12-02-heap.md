In this post, I will talk about the [heap data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)), a specialized tree-based data structure. I will recall how it can be implemented in imperative languages. Finally, I will discuss how heap can be implemented with lists in functional languages and show that it does not satisfy the requirements. A tree-based implementation in OCaml will be given in the next post.
