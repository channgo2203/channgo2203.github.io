1. Some important design issues:
- Hard versus soft real-time
- Safety criticality: e.g. DO-178B/C defines 5 levels of safety:
	- A- the most critical level, a fault leads to catastrophic consequences, 
	- B- leads to severe consequences, 
	- C- leads to major consequences, 
	- D- leads to minor consequences, and 
	- E- leads to consequences without andy effect on the system.
