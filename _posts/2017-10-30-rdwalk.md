## Introduction 

This post shows how a biased random walk can be implemented in OCaml as a recursive 
defition. Consider a walker whoes initial position is `n` where `n` is positive integer 
will go forward `1` step with probability `1/3` and will go backward `1` step with 
probability `2/3`. 

What we are interested in here is what is the number of steps that the walker needs 
to take to go from the position `n` to `0`. Obviously, in the worst-case this number of 
steps is infinite. However, we can show that the probability that this situation 
happens is `0`, e.g., it is `1/3^m` where m go to infinity. We say that this random 
walk algorithm is almost sure termination. 

Thus the more interesting question is what is the expected number of steps that the 
walker needs to take to go from `n` to `0`. If we call `T(n)` is the expected number of steps 
to go from `n` to `0`, then we have the following recursion relation `T(n) = 1 + 1/3T(n+1) + 2/3T(n-1)1`. The solution of this relation is `3.n`. However, the recursion relation solving is not easy problem. If we use our automatic analyzer, [Absynth][1], that can infer the upper bound on this expected value, the we get the   same tightest bound `3.n`.

## Implementation

```ocaml
let rec biased_rw n counter =
   let () = assert (n >= 0) in match n with
   | 0 -> (0, counter)
   | _ -> 
    let r = Random.int 100 in
    (* encode the probability 2/3 *)
    if (r < 67) then 
        biased_rw (n-1) (counter+1) 
    else 
        biased_rw (n+1) (counter+1)

(* testing function *)
let test nr f n =
   let rt = ref 0 in
   for i = 1 to nr do
      let (_,cost) = f n 0 in
      rt := (!rt) + cost
   done; 
   (float_of_int (!rt)) /. (float_of_int nr)
```
The following are the average values of `counter` when we run `biased_rw` for `10000` times.

```ocaml
# test 10000 biased_rw 10;;
- : float = 29.472
```
