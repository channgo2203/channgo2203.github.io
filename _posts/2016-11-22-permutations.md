## The insert-into-all-positions solution

In this post, I will talk about a common approach for generating all permutations, its complexity, and how big the argument list can be that makes the stack overflow using OCaml. I borrow some pictures and work from [typeocaml](http://typeocaml.com/2015/05/05/permutation/).
