## The insert-into-all-positions solution

In this post, I will talk about a general algorithm to generate all possible permutations using OCaml. I borrow some pictures and work from [typeocaml](http://typeocaml.com/2015/05/05/permutation/). I will show how to compute the complexity and in general how big the list that makes the stack overflow.
