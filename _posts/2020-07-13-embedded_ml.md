In this post, I want to discuss about a very new topic and/or concept-- machine learning-based (ML) real-time embedded software. That means how to build machine learning 
applications on resource contrainsts devices and they satisfy real-time properties.

General speaking, you need to know both machine learning and real-time embedded software development. And I think very few people are experts on both, so this post will 
discuss steps to build such kind of ML-based real-time embedded software. It is expected that there is a series of posts.

To be continued...
