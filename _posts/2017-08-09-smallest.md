In this post, I would like to start a topic about functional algorithm design. I will use OCaml language to implement the designs.
Each post is about a "functional pearl" from the book ["Pearls of Functional Algorithm Desgin"][1] by Richard Bird. 

## Introduction

Given a set `X` of `n` natural numbers, we want to find the smallest natural number such that it is not in `X`. In practice, this problem can
be considered as the following common programming task. There is a number of object ids and `X` is the set of objects currently in use. The task
is to find some object not in use, say the one with the smallest id.

## Non-linear Solution

We assume that `X` is a list without duplicates in no particular order. Otherwise, let's say `X` is in increasing order, then the solution is trivial: **simply
look for the first gap and check the first element is different from `0`**. For example,

`X` = [1; 2; 3;
