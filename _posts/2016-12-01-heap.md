In this post, I will talk about the 
[heap data structure][1], a specialized 
tree-based data structure. I will recall how it can be implemented in imperative languages. 
Finally, I will discuss how heap can be implemented with lists in functional languages 
and show that it does not satisfy the requirements. A tree-based implementation in OCaml 
will also be given in this post.

## Heap data-type

A (complete) binary (min) heap is a binary tree that satisfies the following conditions:

* __Shape property__: it is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree, 
except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the 
tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.

* __Heap property__: the key stored in each node is less than or equal to the keys in 
the node's children, according to some total order.

Figure 1 shows an example of a complete binary min heap, the numbers represent the value 
of the keys in the nodes.

Heap is known for its efficient algorithms (logarithmic time complexity) of inserting 
and deleting the smallest element in implementing a priority queue. It is also used in 
implementing [heapsort algoritm][2] that has $$O(nlogn)$$ time complexity.

In imperative world, a heap is generally placed in an array with the layout of complete 
binary tree, mapping complete binary tree nodes to the array indices. For instance, with 
the zero-based array, the root node is represented by index `0`, if `i` is the index of 
the parent, then the indices of its left and right child are: `left_child(i) = 2*i + 1`
and `right_child(i) = 2*i + 1`. However, in functional languages, if we implement an array 
using list data-structure. Then we cannot obtain the constant time complexity for 
accessing elements of the array. Therefore, lists cannot be used to implement efficient 
heaps. Instead, we need to use tree data structures to implement heaps in functional world. 
The following will explain how we heaps are implemented in this way, especially how a new 
node is inserted into and the min node is removed from a heap with $$O(logn)$$ time 
complexity. 

A complete binary heap is represented by a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap 
property. A node can be a terminal node, called `Leaf` or a non-terminal node, called 
`Node`, that contains 
information about the number of nodes, the height, the key, its left and right trees. 
We will see that the number of nodes and the height help us decide to add a new node on 
the left or right child tree. The heap data-type is given in the following snippet. 

```ocaml
(** type of node value. *)
type key = El.t

(** a node contains # nodes, height, left tree, key, and right tree. *)
type heap = Leaf
            | Node of int * int * heap * key * heap
```

## Insert a new node

We consider an example of inserting `0` into the following integer heap. We first need to determine which direction for inserting, insert to the left subtree or to the right subtree, in order to satisfy the __shape property__. In this example, the left tree is full, so we should insert `0` into the right tree. We insert `0` to the bottom level of the heap. Because `0` is smaller than its parent, `6`, so we swap `0` and `6`. After swapping, it is obvious that `0` is smaller than `3`, thus we swap again `0` and `3`. Finally, `0` is smaller than `1`, so we swap `0` and `1`. At this point, the new heap satisfies both __shape property__ and __heap property__.

In general, we have the following algorithm that takes $$O(logn)$$ runtime to insert a key into a heap.

* Since $$2^h <= n <= 2^(h+1) - 1$$, if $$n = 2^(h+1) - 1$$ (the tree is perfect complete) then insert to the left tree. Or if $$2^h <= n < 2^h + 2^(h-1)$$ (the left tree is not full) then insert to the left tree. Otherwise insert to the right tree.

* 1. Add the new key to the bottom level of the heap

  2. Compare the added key with its parent, if they are in the correct order, then stop

  3. If not, swap it with its parent, then goto 2.
