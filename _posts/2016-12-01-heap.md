In this post, I will talk about the 
[heap data structure][1], a specialized 
tree-based data structure. I will recall how it can be implemented in imperative languages. 
Finally, I will discuss how heap can be implemented with lists in functional languages 
and show that it does not satisfy the requirements. A tree-based implementation in OCaml 
will also be given in this post.

A (complete) binary (min) heap is a binary tree that satisfies the following conditions:
* __Shape property__: it is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree, 
except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the 
tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
* __Heap property__: the key stored in each node is less than or equal to the keys in 
the node's children, according to some total order.

Figure 1 shows an example of a complete binary min heap, the numbers represent the value 
of the keys in the nodes.
