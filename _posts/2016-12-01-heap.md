In this post, I will talk about the 
[heap data structure][1], a specialized 
tree-based data structure. I will recall how it can be implemented in imperative languages. 
Finally, I will discuss how heap can be implemented with lists in functional languages 
and show that it does not satisfy the requirements. A tree-based implementation in OCaml 
will also be given in this post.
