In this post, I am excited to introduce __`Xequation`__

![Xequation]({{ site.url }}/img/Xequation.png){:height="36%" width="36%"}{:.center}

The objective of __`Xequation`__ is to provide:
* Solutions and tool development for verifying the robustness and reliability of Machine Learning (ML)-based safety-critical applications such as localization, perception, and planning modules in autnomous driving software stack
  
* Solutions for integrating autnomous driving software modules such as perception module integration

* Overall architecture and design solutions for autonomous driving technology such as the software infrastructure and the middleware
