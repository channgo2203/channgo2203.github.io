In this post, I am excited to introduce __`Xequation`__

![Xequation]({{ site.url }}/img/Xequation.png)

The objective of __`Xequation`__ is to provide:
* Overall architecture and design solutions for autonomous vehicle technology such as the software infrastructure and the middleware
* Solutions for integrating autnomous driving software modules such as perception module integration
* Solutions and tool development for verifying the robustness of autnomous driving software modules that have probabilistic features such as localization, Machine Learning (ML)-based perception, planning modules
