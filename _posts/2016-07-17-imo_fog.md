### Problem
There are \\(n \geq 2)\\ line segments in the plane such that every two segments cross, and no three segments meet at a point. Geoff has to choose an endpoint of each segment and place a frog on it, facing the other endpoint. Then he will clap his hands \\n - 1\\ times. Every time he claps, each frog will immediately jump forward to the next intersection point on its segment. Forgs never change the direction of their jumps. Geoff wishes to place the frogs in such a way that no two of them will ever occupy the same intersection point at the same time. 

1. Prove that Geoff can always fulfil his wish if \\n\\ is odd.
1. Prove that Geoff can never fulfil his wish if \\n\\ is even.

### Discussion
I will not talk about the proof in mathematics. You can think about it. Here I would like to relate this problem to the race problem in _multi-threaded programming_. As a result, it will come to the _dead-lock problem_ in software engineering.
