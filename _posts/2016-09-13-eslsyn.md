I found a student at __IIT India__ implementing our work in the paper published at 
__ESLSyn-DAC__, IEEE, 2014 
["Precise Deadlock Detection for Polychronous Data-flow Specifications"][1]. She/he 
is guided by Dr. Sandeep Shukla.

## Project
You can look at the on-going report [here][2]. Hopefully, she/he will have a nice 
tool after.
