### Precise deadlock detection for polychronous data-flow specifications
I found a student at IIT India implementing our work in the paper published at ESLSyn - DAC, IEEE, 2014. She/he is guided by Dr. Sandeep Shukla.

You can look at the on-going report here http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rachitac/CS395a/report.pdf
Hopefully, he/she will have a nice tool after.
