I found a student at IIT India implementing our work in the paper published at ESLSyn - DAC, IEEE, 2014- Precise Deadlock Detection for Polychronous Data-flow Specifications. She/he is guided by Dr. Sandeep Shukla.

## Project
You can look at the on-going report [here](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rachitac/CS395a/report.pdf).
Hopefully, she/he will have a nice tool after.
