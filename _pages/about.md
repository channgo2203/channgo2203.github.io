My research interests are in safety critical software, especially ML-based safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving software, programming languages, compilers, and language-based security.

I received my Engineer degree (equivalent to Diplôme d'Ingénieur) from 
[Hanoi University of Technology](http://en.hust.edu.vn/home) with excellent ranking, 
my M.Sc in Computer Science (under a French government scholarship, Évariste Galois program) 
from [Joseph Fourier University](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/?language=en) 
(Université de Grenoble), and my Ph.D from [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/) 
France under the supervision of [Dr. Jean-Pierre Talpin](http://www.irisa.fr/prive/talpin/).

I am interested in building reliable and secure computer systems by developing formal frameworks
which guarantee that software satisfies formally its specification, especially embedded safety-critical
software such as automotive, avionic, and health-care applications. The construction of a formal framework
involves the research and knowledge of principles of programming languages, compiler design and development,
and formal methods including model checking, theorem proving, and static analysis for providing
formal assurances that the specification is fulfilled.

A common theme is constructing correct Machine Learning-based safety-critical systems such as autonomous 
vehicles by applying formal verification including static analysis, model checking and correctness proof 
on the source code implementation, or mathematical models of these systems. One of the application is the 
correctness and robustness analysis of localization, perception, and motion planning software modules in 
the autonomous software stack. Another application is providing analysis w.r.t the safety standards 
such as ISO-26262-6 and SOTIF.
