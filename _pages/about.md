I received my Engineer degree (equivalent to Diplôme d'Ingénieur) from 
[Hanoi University of Technology](http://en.hust.edu.vn/home) with excellent ranking, 
my M.Sc in Computer Science (under a French government scholarship, Évariste Galois program) 
from [Joseph Fourier University](https://www.ujf-grenoble.fr/?language=en) 
(Université de Grenoble), and my Ph.D from [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/) 
France under the supervision of [Dr. Jean-Pierre Talpin](http://www.irisa.fr/prive/talpin/). 
I was research fellow in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

I am interested in building reliable and secure computer systems by developing formal frameworks
which guarantee that software satisfies formally its specification, especially embedded safety-critical
software such as automotive, avionic, and health-care applications. The construction of a formal framework
involves the research and knowledge of principles of programming languages, compiler design and development,
and formal methods including model checking, theorem proving, and static analysis for providing
formal assurances that the specification is fulfilled.

Hands-on architecture design and coding of embedded software and embedded Linux from bare-metal, OS abstraction,
middleware, to applications layers. They can be machine learning-based SW in robotics, automotive, medical, and aerospace industries. 
Knowledge and experience with HW bring-up, RTOS, communication protocols such as TCP/IP, CAN, BLE, peripherals like PCIe, I2C, SPI, HSM, middleware frameworks like DDS, ROS2, and QEMU-based emulators.
  
Deep knowledge and strong experience with design and development of compiler, programming language static analysis from scratch or using infrastructures such as LLVM, MLIR.
